Woop woop!

The reason I made this website was because I wanted to learn a bit more about deploying and hosting websites. So, it seemed like a worthwhile opportunity to also learn some frontend skills and to create something which could represent me as a developer.

The site was made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), the handy static site generator.
