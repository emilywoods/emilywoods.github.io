This is a short post about my current laptop setup.

I recently changed laptops, and had a lot of fun setting up and configuring
my new one. I actually spent a couple of weeks trying out new setups on virtual
machines beforehand, so I could find something I really liked. Previously I
had been using OSX for development and day-to-day
activities. It was pretty nice - everything just works and there's not much
faff in setting it up. But it felt like time for a change!

A MacBook was the first laptop I received as a developer - it was handed to me 
on my first day working as a junior developer and I got used to it, so I didn't
really consider using anything else when I moved to my next tech job. 
But now, after 3.5 years of development, I wanted to try something else.
Here's why:

- I work as an infrastructure engineer these days and wanted to use a 
Linux-based operating system (OS), since the servers and machines I work with
mostly run Linux too. 
- I wanted to configure and personalise my setup more.
- I wanted to use more open source software.

In the process of deciding which OS to use, I tried out a couple, mainly
[ElementaryOS](https://elementary.io/), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
with [KDE](https://kde.org/) then [i3](https://i3wm.org/),
and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) with 
[Regolith](https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-desktop). 

I decided on using Ubuntu with Regolith Desktop, because:

- I liked using i3 with Debian and I quickly grew to prefer a tiling 
window manager.
- Regolith is made up of a collection of components, many of which are
modular and replaceable. I switched out a couple and added a few extra i3
shortcuts, but otherwise everything works well for me. 
- My laptop came with Ubuntu installed, and I didn't feel the need to change
it.
