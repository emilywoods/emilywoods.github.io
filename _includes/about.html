                    Hello, my name is Emily.
                <p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>
                    I'm a <b>engineer</b> - mostly of <b>software</b> these days, but this has been known to vary. :)</a>
                </p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>
                    My career has always been STEM-focused: I studied an undergraduate degree in
                    <a href="https://www.ucc.ie/en/processeng/" target="_blank">Process and Chemical Engineering</a>,
                    and completed postgraduate <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/bioengineering" target="_blank">
                    Biomedical Engineering</a> research studies with the <a href="http://www.nsblab.org/" target="_blank">
                    Non-invasive Surgery and Biopsy Laboratory</a> at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/"target="_blank">
                    Imperial College London</a>.
                </p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>
                    I <b>love learning</b> (and don't actually know what to do with myself when I'm not learning something
                    new).
                </p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>
                    I feel strongly about <b>software testing</b> and test driven development.
                    I previously worked as an engineer in a production plant, where a large portion of my
                    role was spent mitigating risks, and understanding how systems and processes could fail.
                    Iâ€™ve taken this mindset to my role as a software developer, and strive to create well-tested
                    systems whose behaviour I can have confidence in.
